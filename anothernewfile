A wonderful and kind new friend of mine, who is a dual British/Iranian citizen, had decided to fly to the U.S.A. from London so she could be with her S.O. The trip was supposed to be a month away, but they had decided that under the circumstances they wanted to act quickly.

She was so worried going through U.S.A immigration that the border guard held her hand and said not to worry so she could stop shaking enough for her fingerprint to be taken.

Her kind and generous boyfriend remained restless all day while the extremely kind immigration lawyer I had introduced to him in the morning gave fantastic advice at each stage of the trip. The advice mainly consisted of basic principles and specific people who could help and their details. Iâ€™ll post the general advice shortly.
